Project 2: Fire station location program
A program to help city planners determine where best to locate a fire station, given up to 20 house locations. The goal is to pick a subset of facilities to open, to minimize the sum of distances from each demand point to its nearest facility. 
We can say that all house and fire station locations lie on a grid. The score of a fire station will be the sum of the Euclidean distances of all the un-serviced homes from the fire station.
