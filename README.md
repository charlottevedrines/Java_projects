Java projects completed in the scope of University of Toronto course MIE250: Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming

**Course description:**
Introduction to object-oriented programming using the Java programming language with heavy emphasis on practical application; variable types; console and file input/output; arithmetic; logical expressions; control structures; arrays; modularity; functions; classes and objects; access modifiers; inheritance; polymorphism; fundamental data structures; design and implementation of programs relevant to industrial engineering needs according to strict specifications.

**Project 1:** Fire station location program
A program to help city planners determine where best to locate a fire station, given up to 20 house locations. The goal is to pick a subset of facilities to open, to minimize the sum of distances from each demand point to its nearest facility. 
We can say that all house and fire station locations lie on a grid. The score of a fire station will be the sum of the Euclidean distances of all the un-serviced homes from the fire station.

**Project 2:** Polynomial local minimizer
The goal of this project is to find the minimum of a nth degree polynomial function. Three different versions of the steepest descent algorithm are implemeted in OOP to determine the local minimum of a polynomial. The three performances are then compared to determine the most accurate and efficient algorithm. This project requires knowledge of file loading, OOP and inheritance.
